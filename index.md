- An excited psychology master student interested in attention and working memory, with EEG, TMS, and fMRI facilities.
- I'm an optimistic and energetic being, a team worker, and a patient endeavor.
- During my leisure time, I like going to park and museum, watching animate and gaming. Also, I'm interested in music. I sing a lot, and I play guitar, piano, and cucurbit  flute. On rare occassions, I write songs. Additionally, language learning is always an intriguing task for me, if not for exams:) I self-studied Japanese from watching animate, and Koran from variety shows.
